A big part of the philosophy behined Statico is that as far as possible, it uses off-the-shelf PHP libraries that you may already be familiar with. This has the following advantages:

* Many users will already know these libraries, making the learning curve shallower
* These libraries already have a rich ecosystem of extensions and support, making it easier for us to produce a flexible solution without coding everything ourselves
